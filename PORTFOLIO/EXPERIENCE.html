        <b>AT THE AGE GROUP OF 13-18</b>
        my experience about my life during the age group of 13-18 
        was good. I had learned to how to deal with problems 
        mostly related with studies.
        I had learnt the basic use of computer, like the use of 
        word, powerpoint, and shortcuts of keybords.
        I have focused on my studies and also palyed the cricket too much.
